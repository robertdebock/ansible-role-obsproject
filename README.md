Install obsproject on your system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/playbook.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - robertdebock.obsproject
```

The machine you are running this on, may need to be prepared, I use this playbook to ensure everything is in place to let the role work.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap
    - robertdebock.epel
    - robertdebock.rpmfusion
```

After running this role, this playbook runs to verify that everything works, this may be a good example how you can use this role.
```yaml
---
- name: Verify
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  tasks:
    - name: check if connection still works
      ping:
```

Also see a [full explanation and example](https://robertdebock.nl/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

Role Variables
--------------

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml

The minimum version of Ansible required is 2.8 but tests have been done to:

- The previous version, on version lower.

- The development version.

Exceptions
----------

Some variarations of the build matrix do not work. These are the variations and reasons why the build won't work:

| variation                 | reason                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| opensuse | Requires [much more efforts](https://obsproject.com/wiki/install-instructions#opensuse-installation-unofficial) than usual. |
| alpine | obs-studio (missing) |
| centos:latest | nothing provides libSDL2-2.0.so.0()(64bit) needed by ffmpeg-4.2.1-3.el8.x86_64 |
| amazonlinux | Missing dependecies |


Testing
-------

[Unit tests](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-obsproject) are done on every commit, pull request, release and periodically.

If you find issues, please register them in [GitHub](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-obsproject/issues)

Testing is done using [Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule):

[Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) tests multiple ansible versions.
[Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule) tests multiple distributions.

To test using the defaults (any installed ansible version, namespace: `robertdebock`, image: `fedora`, tag: `latest`):

```
molecule test

# Or select a specific image:
image=ubuntu molecule test
# Or select a specific image and a specific tag:
image="debian" tag="stable" tox
```

Or you can test multiple versions of Ansible, and select images:
Tox allows multiple versions of Ansible to be tested. To run the default (namespace: `robertdebock`, image: `fedora`, tag: `latest`) tests:

```
tox

# To run CentOS (namespace: `robertdebock`, tag: `latest`)
image="centos" tox
# Or customize more:
image="debian" tag="stable" tox
```
